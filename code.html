<P>Success is 1% dreaming, 99% doing. <br>Best ideas in the world are worthless if you don't act on them. <br>Before you can succeed, you have to believe you can succeed. <br>If you don't have a clear idea of where you want to go, you are not going anywhere. <br>There are no successful people who are aimless.

		<li>Leran while they play</li>
		<li>Save while they spend</li>
		<li>Live while they dream </li>
